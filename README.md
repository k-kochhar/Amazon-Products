# Amazon-Products

This was a pretty basic project that I made to mess around with web scraping with the BeautifulSoup library

You basically input the name of a product and how many results you want, and it will return different
products that match your name, along with their price, reviews, URL, and other data on Amazon.

It works best when you put in a specific product. (Putting down "Playstation 5", instead of like "game console")
